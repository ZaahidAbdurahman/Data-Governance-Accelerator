#  Chapter 1

In this chapter, we will be:

-  Unpacking the definition of data governance

-  Discovering the elements of a data governance program

-  Understanding the role of data culture

-  Determining data governance readiness.

#  Understanding Data Governance

-  The topic of data governance seems abstract to far too many people without a full appreciation of its definition, role, and value.

#  What is meant by governance?

-  When first presented with the phrase data governance, most people immediately understand the data part, but can be quickly confused by the use and context of the word “governance.”

-  Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.

-  Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained.

#  What is data governance?

-  As the video explained to be effective at their jobs, staff want to find the data they need quickly, and they want it to be high-quality data.

-  This means the data needs to be accurate and current.

-  Leaders want data to provide the basis for rich insights that enable timely and informed data-driven decision-making.

-  Data governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.

#  Data Governance Versus Data Management

-  Within the EIM space, there are many terms that sound like they might mean the same thing.

-    There is often confusion about the difference between data governance and data management.

-    Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data.

-    Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.

-    Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.

#  The Value of Data Governance

-  If an organization considers data to be a priority — and an increasing number of businesses believe just that (in fact, according to Anmut

-   a data consultancy, 91 percent of business leaders say that data is a critical part of their organization’s success)

  -  Fundamentally, data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. 
  
  -  It forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature.

 #  Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:

-  Improved data quality

-  Expanded data value

-  Increased data compliance

-  Improved data-driven decision-making

-  Enhanced business performance

-  Improved data search

#  Creating a Data Governance Program

The basic steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following. These steps also form the basic outline of this course.

-  Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.

-  Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.

-  Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.

-  Achieving leadership approval.

-  Designing and developing the program.

-  Implementing the program.

-  Monitoring and measuring performance.

-  Maintaining the program.

  Developing a Data Governance Framework

-  You cannot buy a data governance program off the shelf.

-  That’s actually good news.

-  Organizations must implement a program relative to its level of interest, as well as its needs, budget, and capabilities.

-  While there are many framework variations to choose from, including ISACA’s Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) IT governance framework.

-  They share some common components that address people, processes, and technology.

#  Leadership and Strategy

-  Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.

-  For example, how can data governance support the role that data plays in enabling growth in specific markets?

#  Roles and Responsibilities

-  Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time.

-  Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.

#  Policies, Processes, and Standards

-  At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization.

-  Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed.

-  Depending on the size and complexity of the organization, this can take significant effort.

#  Metrics

-  The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results.

-  Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding.

#  Tools

-  Fortunately, a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management.

-  These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance.

#  Communications and Collaboration

-  With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key.

-  This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.

-  Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.

#  Preparing for Data Governance

-  It might seem a good idea just to form a team, create a plan, buy some tools, and then implement data governance.

-  That would be a mistake. Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it.

-  As the following sections make clear, there are some traps that you can avoid if you and your team are diligent.

#  What is data culture?

-  Many well-designed projects and initiatives fall flat and fail even though their teams seem to have done everything right.

-  Too often, the work gets deployed into an environment that is either not ready for change or doesn’t have the optimum conditions for success.

#  Assessing the Data Culture

-  If you want to increase your chances of success - you need to understand the data culture of your organization and determine how to broaden and mature it if necessary.

-  In a data culture, decisions don’t rely on gut feelings, guesses, or the opinion of the highest-paid/ranking person in the room.

-  Rather, decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce.

#  Maturing the Data Culture

-  If you decide that you need to better prepare the organization for data governance by maturing the data culture, consider these items to start.

-  Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority.

-  This must include communicating the positive results of using data.

-  Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization.

#  Assessing Data Governance Readiness

-  So, you’ve either determined your organization has a good data culture, or you’ve put into action some steps to help move it forward, and now you’ve decided it’s time to roll up your sleeves and begin designing a data   governance program.

  The following basic checklist of items will help you determine the data governance readiness of your organization:

-  The basis of a data culture exists.

-  The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.

-  Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.

-  One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.

-  The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.

-  The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.

-  You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
